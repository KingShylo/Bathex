  <p> <span> There are, however, a few things that we cannot include in this limited warranty offer. </span></p>

<h5> Fair wear and tear </h5>
<p> All our products are subject to wear during the life of the product, especially our moving hinge products (such as Hinge Arms and Shower Seats). The hinge components of these items can wear out after prolonged high usage and we would treat that as fair wear and tear. Similarly, there are products which do get dirty with soap grime, cleaning materials and water deposits (including shower curtains, shower seats, shower hooks, and back rest cushions) and this would also be treated as fair wear and tear. Finally, the surfaces of our products may become dull or scratched over time and again this would be treated as fair wear and tear. Fair wear and tear is not covered by our warranty. </p>


<h5> Proper storage, use, installation, and maintenance </h5>
<p> Our products are designed for the specific purposes that they are intended for, and the use of our products outside of the intended use would render any warranty invalid. The installation and use of any mild steel products in wet areas (including chrome plated products) will invalidate the warranty. Similarly, the incorrect storage or installation of our products will impair the proper function and if the reason for a problem is caused for these reasons then, again the warranty will not apply. Finally, the products do need to be looked after properly in accordance with our ‘Care and Maintenance Instructions’ and failure to follow these instructions will render the warranty invalid. A common occurrence is where products have been damaged by excessively strong bleach, acids or alkalis. </p>


<h5> Malicious or accidental damage </h5>
<p> Our warranty does not cover any damage to products for malicious or accidental reasons. This includes breakage of any glass items such as our glass shelves.</p>


<h5> Warranty Claims </h5>
<p> If you believe you have a claim against our warranty, then please contact us by phone or e-mail and we will promptly evaluate your claim and fix it if it is our fault or explain clearly to you why it is not something we can cover. </p>

<h3> Care and Maintenance Instructions </h3>
<p> <span>Our products are very robust, and made from high quality materials, but they can be damaged by not following the correct care, cleaning and maintenance processes. </span></p>
<p>Our products should ideally only be cleaned with a damp cloth using a mild detergent or soap. </p>
<p> Where it is necessary to use surfactants or cleaning chemicals then they must be diluted in accordance with the manufacturer’s instructions, or ready mixed in concentrations appropriate to the environment being cleaned. Lemon based cleaning solutions should be avoided as they are known to be quite acidic and can attack certain surfaces such as our stainless steel products. </p>
<p> Using undiluted bleach, concentrated acids or alkali’s, chloride solutions and any hydrochloric acid based cleaners will damage the surfaces of our products and these must be avoided. Our warranty will not apply in cases where there is clear chemical attack to the surfaces. </p>
<p> Using scouring powders or cleaning materials with abrasives within the liquid (e.g. CIF) will cause a scouring mechanical cleaning action to take place which can damage the surface. Painted surfaces will become dulled. Mirror polished surfaces will be scratched and dulled. Sateen polished surfaces can accommodate this cleaning reasonably well but only if the direction of the polish grain is followed. It is best to avoid such cleaners unless there really is no option to remove accumulated deposits. If the product surface is damaged by such cleaners, then our warranty will not apply. </p>
<p> Finally, where hard water deposits are a problem then it is important to keep up with cleaning the lime scale deposits with a suitable lime scale cleaner (suitably diluted), If the scale builds up to a significant extent then it is likely to need some form of mechanical or abrasive cleaning which is likely to damage the surface of the product. Keeping any product pristine in a hard water environment is difficult and it is likely that products will become dulled and some deposits experienced in these environments. This is not a function of our products and is not covered by our warranty.</p>
